A backup version with the date in the filename. I was surprised that while writing for a year I had no problem knowing which version was the most recent one. Nevertheless I kept a backup copy on an external harddisc that I updated after finishing a few pages. For clarity, I added the date to the filename.




7. A silent start. Aka a starting mentally. Before starting the real work I thought a lot about the work and the entire project. About which structure would be reasonable, about what would fit in particular chapters. I collected notes on paper. I tried to get interested in the challenge that writing a PhD thesis is. During that period I avoided sharing my ideas with anyone – the thesis was such a huge mental burden that conversation about it motivated me to procrastrinate it. Transforming it into a solvable problem took some time, but after that it was easier to start writing.

8. Portions. Small parts are easier to write. Half a page per day (or one paragraph) worked a lot better than three pages (or a short section) within a week. Sometimes it was possible to achieve more... Better surprise yourself with productivity than create a feeling of guilt – a week passed and the chapter is still unwritten. If you achieve six small successes within that week instead they add up to an additional big one, and if it fails once, it is only a small backdrop.

9. If in doubt where to start, start with the literature. An exemplary section about RNA in medicine emerged like this: I searched all neccessary literature  I noted the most important aspects from them for my thesis  I sorted all the content collected so far in a logical order  Based on that, I wrote my text. This method facilitated mostly writing the introduction. It is essential not to copy-paste text and cite all sources accordingly. Especially if you are planning to work together with Angela Merkel or Viktor Orban. 

10. Small bursts of concentration. Write for 2-3 hours at max... and only write... seriously. No checking emails, no Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest etc. (I blocked a couple of junk websites in my browser). When reading or translating publications, focus on thos that are needed, not on those „oh how interesting, maybe it will be useful some day.”. Just three hours and then a break without the computer.

11. A reviewer. Showing your text to someone who says „great, go on writing!”. That person confirms that a given fragment of text is unerstandable and displayable to the committee. After finishing a chapter I often felt the urge to improve it further. Smoothen sentences, add more references. It is very easy to get caught in that, which is why I left the entire proofreading for the end, and my external reviewer (could also be mum, sister, or dad) pushed me forward saying „Yes, this is excellent enough”. 


KR notes:
15. Lock yourself in. I had the most productive period of writing when I took refuge in my moms empty flat for a week. There were much less distractions.
