<h1>Anatomy of a Conference Poster</h1>

<p>For a scientist, the conference poster is one of the basic communication tools. You get the opportunity to create posters early in your career, and probably you will create lots of them. But what makes a good poster? In this article you find three rules I learned after <b>"Eight steps for creating better bioinformatics software"</b>, my approximately 20th poster, won a <i>best poster award</i>.</p><div class="media"><a href="files/SoftDev_GCB_2010.pdf"><img class="media-object" src="images/gcb_poster.png"></a></div><h3>1. Target the right audience</h3><p>We designed the <i>"Eight steps"</i> poster explicitly for winning the contest. We took it to the GCB 2010, a conference attended mainly by bioinformaticians. We wanted to offer them useful ideas. The title and contents addressed everybody involved in developing programs - practically all conference attendants. I admit that we were lucky because the winner was actually voted for by the attendants themselves (a jury might have had other criteria). Instead of all praticipants you might aim for a particular subgroup of scientists. Knowing who you design a poster for helps you make decisions early on. <b>Choose your target wisely, then dress to kill ;-)</b>.</p><h3>2. Layout rules</h3><p>Unfortunately there are many posters which are optically indigestible: elements are arranged randomly, filling all empty space. In the <i>"Eight steps"</i> poster we chose a simple grid layout. Our aim was to show 8 tools. The grid layout supports such an enumeration of components, suggesting they are equal. The background color adds contrast and makes the layout more recognizable. We added a title to each box, numbering the tools 1-8. All of these factors contribute to the core message of the poster.</p><h3>3. Less text is more</h3><p>A poster is not a scientific article. My first conference poster had about 2000 words. I doubt many people have read it. For <i>"Eight steps"</i> we decided to limit the main paragraph in each box to five lines, and let the pictures do the speaking. Good pictures help a lot not only to make your poster more interesting, but also more self-explanatory. By creating one diagram for each box, the reader could easily focus on one box at a time and follow the boxes in a random order. Again, that supported the core message. Limiting text and using pictures instead heps you to create a self-explanatory poster where visitors can decide how much to read at a time.</p><h3>Room for improvement</h3><p>There are many things I am not satisfied with: Boxes 1, 2 and 9 contain more than one visual element. Box 3 is correct, but looks boring. The margins are abysmally small. Clearly, making posters is an art. But what I learned is that when you think about making your poster clearly understandable you stop presenting and start communicating. And in my opinion communication is what makes conference posters very rewarding.</p>
