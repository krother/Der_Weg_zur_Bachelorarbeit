<h1>Nine Ways to do Scientific Writing</h1>

<p>When I was writing my first paper, I thought writing meant sitting in front of a keyboard, starting to type and continuing until the paper was done. Not surprisingly, frequently this approach did not work, and I experienced what is called a <b>writers block</b>. It took me years to realize that writing as a process is much more complex. Writing a paper includes many activities, only some of which involve typing. Here are nine of them:</p><div class="media"><img class="media-object" src="images/writing_modes.png" width="400"></div><ol><li><b>Find a core message</b> - What is your article trying to say? Many writing guides recommend you can have only one message per article. How would you summarize your paper in one sentence?</li><li><b>Collect ideas</b> - To write reasonable science, you need raw material: facts, observations, references. Collecting your raw material means reading literature, reviewing your own notes and brainstorming points you could write.</li><li><b>Freewriting</b> - A way to generate text from scratch. Set a timer to 10 minutes. Start writing. Do not stop before time runs out. Freewriting means you write a lot of crap. You probably will anyway. But Freewriting gets you through the crap stage faster.</li><li><b>Structure paragraphs</b> - Systematicall construct your text in a top-down fashion. Divide a section into paragraphs. For each paragraph construct an opening and a closing sentence. Add a few main points. Then move to the next paragraph etc.</li><li><b>Writing</b> - Sitting at the keyboard and wrestling with single words and sentences is still part of the game. Make sure yo have a coffee to sip, a cat to stroke, a pen to gnaw.</li><li><b>Proofread</b> - Indispensable when quality is to come your way. Read your text. Edit. Read it again. Check grammar. Check flow between paragraphs. Double-check facts.</li><li><b>Create figures</b> - Many scientists recommend to start with the figures. If your figures tell a coherent story, the text in between will be easier to write.</li><li><b>Collect references</b> - You could argue that writing starts when you start collecting literature. Make sure you use a reference manager as soon as you have more than three references. It doesn't matter whether you are using <a href="http://www.mendeley.com" target="_blank">Mendeley</a>, <a href="http://endnote.com/" target="_blank">EndNote</a>, <a href="http://www.bibtex.org/" target="_blank">BibTeX</a> or a text file with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed" target="_blank">PMIDs</a>. All four will save you hours.</li><li><b>Format the manuscript</b> - make everything look nice and make sure you follow the guidelines of the journal by the letter. Once you arrive here, you are rolling downhill.</li></ol>

<h3>Switch activities to overcome writers' block</h3>
<p>You can spend your time in at least these nine ways while writing a paper. Before your manuscript is finished, you will move through each square of the diagram a few times. Realizing that gives you a recipe against writers' block: <b>If what you are doing doesn't work out, switch to a different activity.</b></p>
