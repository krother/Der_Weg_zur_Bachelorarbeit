<h1>Clear Layouts for Conference Posters</h1>

<p>A clear visual structure is key to engaging conference posters. On an attractive poster the spectator can grasp the main idea within a few seconds. A good layout supports the main idea. </p><p>You probably have seen posters with three-columns of text resembling a scientific papers. There is nothing wrong with papers, but I think <i>Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion</i> make rather boring headlines, especially when dozens of other posters do the same. A good poster uses visual structure to support its message, not just text.</p><p>Below, you find examples of layouts that convey meaning visually. They were inspired by the book ‘Reading Images’ [1]. </p><div class="media"><img src="images/posters123.png" class="media-object"></div>

<h3>The array layout</h3><p>The array layout features rectangular boxes of equal size in a regular arrangement. The subliminal message is thatthe authors have identified and categorized items that share a quality. They enumerate them without special preference. The array layout is like a gallery: You display all your specimens or findings next to each other. The array layout is great to show many aspects of your work, especially, if there is no superstar among them. Also it is easy to fit in an abstract and acknowledgements in two corners. </p>

<h3>The story layout</h3><p>People like to hear stories. Researchers like to hear research stories. The story layout emphasizes a chronological sequence of events like a story, chain of events or workflow. You can arrange elements on a timeline, or place subsequent elements closer to each other. In contrast to the array layout, you may find non-rectangular elements like trapezoids, ellipses or clouds worth trying here. The story layout naturally fits to the Introduction-Methods-Results-Discussion mantra. Therefore it may be easier to conceptualize than the other layouts. But you may tell any kind of research story that has a beginning, end and some tension in between. If you like to describe your research by telling a story, this layout helps you to guide your listeners through it.</p>

<h3>The star layout</h3><p>The star layout emphasizes one single aspect of your work: One key molecule, one main outcome, one mainquestion. By exposing that aspect visually by size, position, and graphical elements, you make that aspectobvious to passers-by. The other visual elements provide extra detail but only for those interested. The ‘star’ element may be in the centre or a bigger box at the border. It could be a superb image, or a single line of text. As long as the ‘star’ stands on its own, you have a poster that easily gets attention. The big advantage of the star layout is that it makes iteasy to pitch your poster in 10 seconds. You offer spectators a clear starting point for further conversation.</p>

<h3>Metaphoric layouts</h3><p>You can build your layout around a visual metaphor: For instance, a poster could resemble a cell with the content placed in different organelles. Alternatively you could make the entire poster look like a newspaper page. Other metaphors I have seen on scientific posters include a comic, a board game and a supermodel.Metaphor posters are often fun to watch and provide a welcome change to posters overburdened with facts.Because they tend to take more space, creating a metaphor layout requires to strip down your message tothe bare essentials. However, you need to be careful not to oversimplify your science in order to fit a metaphor.</p>

<p>Take a walk through the poster gallery on the corridors of your institute. What do you see?</p>
