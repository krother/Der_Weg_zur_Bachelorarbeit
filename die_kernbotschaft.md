Find Your Central Message

In 1953 Watson, Crick & Franklin discovered that the DNA is a double helix. This simple finding changed the world, and biological research in particular. It is that simplicity that made the impact of the double helix reach far beyond research. The discovery of the double helix has a clear central message. Likewise any scientific text or presentation benefits from having a clear central message.

In this article, you find three guidelines that help to find your own central message.
One message at a time

You can pursue only one central message at a time. Any extra messages weaken the impact of the central one. Imagine the structure of DNA being explained as

"The DNA is a double helix and RNA sometimes makes helices, too".

This is what happened to my PhD thesis. I was struggling for a year to fit two unrelated subjects in. The outcome was not as nice as it could have been. When writing a thesis, you usually get away with two or more central messages. When writing other scientific texts, more messages will confuse your reviewers. For a paper, you can respond to the reviewers, but for a grant application confusion is fatal. Therefore, find one central message and stick to it.
The message must be simple

A good central message can't be too long. Imagine the DNA introduced to the world as

"The DNA is a pair of linear polymers of riboses linked by phosphodiester bonds to which ...".

Yes, scientists are very intelligent persons. We can understand incredibly complex matter if we have to. Only most of the time we don't have to. We prefer a clear statement over one that needs to be decyphered. Simple messages are clear.

Here is an exercise: How would you summarize your results in less than ten words? How would you explain them to a lay person, your parents, your kids? When limit your words you force yourself to prioritize. What is the most important about your discovery? You may find that a central message that is simple is also more beautiful.
Finding a central message means work

A good central message does not come by itself. Reading an article about communication and writing a ten-word sentence is not sufficient. How to make sure that you don't oversimplify? What if you don't know which aspect is the most important? What if your data is complex? The fathers and mothers of the DNA were plunging through a huge pile of observations and contemplating, discussing their meaning. And it was a lot of work.

This is what science is about. Look at your observations, contemplate, discuss. Ask yourself: What does it mean? All to distill a brief summary, an interpretation, a conclusion, that drop of knowledge you can put into a few simple words we called a central message here. It is not easy. But as I said above: Scientists have a lot of brains. Put that grey goo to work. Take the challenge.

Once you have your central message, you can construct publications, presentations, posters, and grant proposals more easily. This is when the work you put into your central message pays off.
Summary

I learned from Edward Potworowski that having One Simple Message is the fundament of successful scientific communication. In order to communicate your science, you need to find one message that is simple enough to be understood and correct enough to be useful.

Think of the greatest discoveries: "Everything consists of atoms", "E = mc2", "Our DNA is 99% identical to chimps".
