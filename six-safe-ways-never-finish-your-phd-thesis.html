<h1>Six Safe Ways to never finish Your PhD Thesis</h1>

<p><b>by Dr. Magdalena Rother and Dr. Kristian Rother</b></p><div class="media"><img src="images/thesis_writing.png" width="500"></div><p>Finally, the great moment is there: Your thesis is ready to be written.<br>uh.. in fact it already has been for a while. You still have a white page in front of you and a huuuge pile of notes on your desk. Your defence is an eternity away.</p><p>This guide will help you to keep it that way. </p><p>We combined our experience from two PhD theses, which we think is a good approximation of eternity. To never finish your PhD, do the following:</p><h3>1. Set ambitious goals</h3><p><i><b>„This month I am going to write the introduction.”</b></i> </p><p>First, a month is a lot of time. If you start tomorrow, you will still have almost an entire month left. You will make it for sure. Second, <i>”introduction”</i> sounds bold enough. Writing a long chapter of 10-30 pages in which you have to demonstrate both broad and specific knowledge is almost too unchallenging. Unless you decide to procrastinate the task <i>ad Kalendas Graecas</i>.</p><h3>2. Write full-time</h3><p><i><b>„Today I am going to write the whole day through”.</b></i></p><p>Typing text into a computer should be easy for an intelligent person. You can easily focus for three hours in a row, so extending that to eight hours is no problem. You are self-disciplined, so your thoughts don't start to wander. You have no desire to get out and talk to people. The internet does not distract you at all. Just sit and type text until your thesis is done.</p><h3>3. Your progress is fully reproducible</h3><p><i><b>„Yesterday I wrote one page, let's do it again today.” </b></i></p><p>Your job is to produce a certain number of pages. A page is a given number of lines, words, and characters. You can measure that. If you are able to complete a certain number on one day, you can achieve the same the next day, too. It does not matter that some pages are occupied by figures, tables, enumerations while others contain complex lines of thought. To write at a constant pace, leave inclusion of figures till the end. Just put a TODO heading in place of the figure or table and trust that you will remember right before printing which image was supposed to be there and where you saved the image file. It does not matter that you may feel exhausted after a successful stretch of writing. A good PhD student sees itself as a human extension of the printing machine. </p><h3>4. Insert references manually</h3><p><i><b>„Who needs EndNote or Mendeley?”</b></i></p><p>After several years of work, you know the publications in your field by heart. You can copy the references into your thesis once and not touch them further. Since you are writing your thesis from the beginning to the end, you will never insert references into the introduction or discussion. Also, formatting your reference section in a consistent style is a good warm-up exercise that should be done daily.</p><h3>5. Print on the latest possible date</h3><p><i><b>„Just press Ctrl-P.”</b></i></p><p>Modern word processors all do WYSIWYG - What You See (on the screen) is What You Get (on the paper). The time needed for printing is limited only by the velocity of the printer. There are no surprises to expect, in particular not in these areas: page margins, resolution of images, colours of images and generating correct cross-references when you export a PDF. Don't check your printed material either. Trust that your references to figures, tables and citations will all be correct. The printer or copy machine is unlikely to get stuck or run out of toner, and staff in copy shops is generally friendly when you ask them to bind six theses a few minutes before they close. Summarizing, printing a thesis is basically the same as printing a single page.</p><h3>6. Never ask for help</h3><p><i><b>„Can't you see I'm working on my thesis?”</b></i></p><p>Unlike a Nobel Prize, you can't share a PhD. That means that you not only have to write the thesis yourself, but any kind of support is unacceptable. That excludes asking a colleague to review for readability, correctness, or structure. Motivation by your family might be seen as cheating. Don't talk to your supervisor about the thesis either. You have prepared a few surprising conclusions for him that will shake up the field.</p><p>If your friends or colleagues are lurking around, asking about your thesis, they probably want to steal your results. Or maybe they are just jealous because with a PhD you soon will be a much better person than they are.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Writing a PhD thesis is the final test of your superhuman abilities. After Hercules had finished cleaning the stables of Augias, nobody asked him what had been inside. With a thesis it is the same: The only thing that counts is volume, not quality. Or is that maybe not such a good idea?</p><p>Carefully reading the six rules above won't get you a PhD. But maybe they give you a fresh view on how you can finish some day. Or at least do something about that empty page in front of you.</p><p><i>We would like to thank Manuel Corpas for his helpful suggestions.</i></p>
